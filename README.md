### Class 18b: Databases

### Databases and SQL
* This [GA slide deck](https://github.com/justmarkham/DAT5/blob/master/slides/20_sql.pdf) provides a brief introduction to databases and SQL. The [Python script](https://github.com/justmarkham/DAT5/blob/master/code/20_sql.py) from that lesson demonstrates basic SQL queries, as well as how to connect to a SQLite database from Python and how to query it using Pandas.
* The repository for this [SQL Bootcamp](https://github.com/brandonmburroughs/sql_bootcamp) contains an extremely well-commented SQL script that is suitable for walking through on your own.
* This [GA notebook](https://github.com/podopie/DAT18NYC/blob/master/classes/17-relational_databases.ipynb) provides a shorter introduction to databases and SQL that helpfully contrasts SQL queries with Pandas syntax.
* [SQLZOO](http://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial), [Mode Analytics](http://sqlschool.modeanalytics.com/), [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql), [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-sql), [Datamonkey](http://datamonkey.pro/guess_sql/lessons/), and [Code School](http://campus.codeschool.com/courses/try-sql/contents) all have online beginner SQL tutorials that look promising. Code School also offers an [advanced tutorial](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/the-sequel-to-sql/), though it's not free.
* [w3schools](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all) has a sample database that allows you to practice SQL from your browser. Similarly, Kaggle allows you to query a large SQLite database of [Reddit Comments](https://www.kaggle.com/c/reddit-comments-may-2015/data) using their online "Scripts" application.
* [What Every Data Scientist Needs to Know about SQL](http://joshualande.com/data-science-sql/) is a brief series of posts about SQL basics, and [Introduction to SQL for Data Scientists](http://bensresearch.com/downloads/SQL.pdf) is a paper with similar goals.
* [10 Easy Steps to a Complete Understanding of SQL](https://web.archive.org/web/20150402234726/http://tech.pro/tutorial/1555/10-easy-steps-to-a-complete-understanding-of-sql) is a good article for those who have some SQL experience and want to understand it at a deeper level.
* SQLite's article on [Query Planning](http://www.sqlite.org/queryplanner.html) explains how SQL queries "work".
* [A Comparison Of Relational Database Management Systems](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/sqlite-vs-mysql-vs-postgresql-a-comparison-of-relational-database-management-systems) gives the pros and cons of SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.
* If you want to go deeper into databases and SQL, Stanford has a well-respected series of [14 mini-courses](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/DB/2014/SelfPaced/about).
* [Blaze](http://blaze.pydata.org) is a Python package enabling you to use Pandas-like syntax to query data living in a variety of data storage systems.
